# TüEyeQ Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and experiments, which accompany the TüEyeQ data set and paper (links will be provided soon).

All experiments are provided in the Jupyter notebook ``analysis.ipynb``. To reproduce the plots and tables shown in the paper, one needs to load the TüEyeQ data set and run all cells of the notebook.
For further information about the experiment's structure, please refer to the comments of the Jupyter notebook and the corresponding paper.

Pre-processed Distance Correlation scores can can be loaded from ``/pre-processed``.
Moreover, all plots from the paper can be found in ``/figures``.

In future, we plan to extend this repository by a selection of benchmark predictive models. We also welcome any contributions from the community.
